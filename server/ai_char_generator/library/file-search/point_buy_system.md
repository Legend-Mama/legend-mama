## Point Buy System for Ability Scores

The point buy system allows players to customize their character's ability scores by distributing a set number of points among the six core abilities: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. This system provides a balanced and fair way to create characters with varying strengths and weaknesses according to the player's preferences.

### Steps to Use the Point Buy System

1. **Set Starting Scores:**
    - Each ability score starts at a base value, typically 8.

2. **Assign Points:**
    - Players receive a pool of points to distribute among the ability scores. In D&D 5th Edition, the standard point pool is 27 points.
    - Players can spend these points to increase their ability scores according to a cost table.

3. **Cost Table:**
    - The cost to increase an ability score is not linear; higher scores cost more points.
    - Scores above 15 are not allowed through the point buy system before applying racial modifiers.

    | Ability Score | Point Cost |
    |---------------|------------|
    | 8             | 0          |
    | 9             | 1          |
    | 10            | 2          |
    | 11            | 3          |
    | 12            | 4          |
    | 13            | 5          |
    | 14            | 7          |
    | 15            | 9          |
